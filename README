YE REQUIREMENTS
-
Chadwick 0.6: http://chadwick.sourceforge.net/
python 2.5+ (don't know about 3.0, sorry)
sqlalchemy: http://www.sqlalchemy.org/

1. create database called 'retrosheet'
2. add schema to the database w/ the included SQL script (the .postgres.sql one works nicely w/ PG, the other w/ MySQL)
3. configure the file db.ini with your appropriate ENGINE, USER, HOST, PASSWORD, DATABASE values - if yer using postgres, you can optionally define SCHEMA and download directory
   valid values for ENGINE are valid sqlalchemy engines e.g. 'mysql', 'postgresql' or 'sqlite'
   if you have your server configured to allow passwordless connections, you don't need to define USER and PASSWORD
   if you are using sqlite3, 'database' in the config should be the path to your database file
   specify directory for retrosheet files to be downloaded to, needs to exist before script runs
4. run download.py to download the files from retrosheet's servers
5. run parse.py to parse the files and insert the data into the database. Optionally run parse.py -y XXXX to import just one year
